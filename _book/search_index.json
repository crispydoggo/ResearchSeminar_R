[["index.html", "Welcome", " Welcome These are the online lecture notes for empirical methods using R from Jaakko Meriläinen’s Research Seminar at ITAM. The lecture notes intend to give the students a basic knowledge regarding data wrangling and plotting: Installing packages Opening data Plotting simple graphs and plotting nicer graphs Combining data files Generating variables Also, in these notes, we cover the most appropriate empirical methods to make causal inferences for students to understand in a basic sense how we can perform the analysis with R: Running (and interpreting) a simple regression Running IV regressions Running simple diff-in-diffs Generating summary statistics tables Running t-tests Producing .tex tables Running RDD Using different kinds of standard errors "],["setting-r.html", "1 Setting R", " 1 Setting R R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics, which can be extended through packages. R was built as an open-source project, meaning every package and software is free! You can visit their site if you are interested in more technical aspects. To start using R, you need to install two complementary things: R: is the raw software that will run the code R Studio: is an Integrated Development Software (IDE), a computer application that provides comprehensive services to make it easier for the developer or programmer to develop software. Both installations are designed to be simple and accessible: R, The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), can be downloaded for any platform. After clicking the link, choose the appropriate (Linux, (Mac) OS X, or Windows) installation file for R. Download and install R on your computer. R studio provides the previous step and its installation in the following link. A nice overview of R Studio interface and windows can be found at RStudio Layout. The reference works through an R Studio server; since our recommendation and approach is to download R studio, you don’t have to worry about logging in.

GitHub Education gives students hands-on experience with free access to various developer tools from GitHub partners. We recommend activating your free trial for DataCamp; it provides R, Python, SQL and more programming courses. I will give you one BIG cookie for every statement of accomplishment you achieve during this semester of DataCamp. If you don’t want to cover the basics in detail, try these small tutorials to familiarize yourself with the R syntax and RStudio: RStudio and Working Environment R syntax, basic objects and operations Further, we will cover some essential aspects just as the bare minimum requirements for understanding these notes to some extent. 2.1 Installing Packages As an open-source project, R has a universe of add-ons; additional content is included as a package. For every idea or problem you may encounter, someone has already worked on it and published it somewhere. To install a package, you need to type install.packages(\"package_name\") into the R console or an R script. Press the enter key if you are in the R console or press the shift + enter key if you are in an R script. install.packages(&quot;estimatr&quot;) # For robust standard errors To load a package, you must type library(package_name). Press the enter key if you are in the R console or press the shift + enter key if you are in an R script. library(estimatr) # Loading the library You only need to install a package once, but you must load a package every time you close and restart R; R needs to know which resources you plan to work with on each session.

The examples follow the empirical exercises of Jaakko’s graduate course Tópicos de Microeconomía at ITAM.For the theory and context of the method, check Chapter 7 of Scott Cunningham’s Causal Inference Mixtape. We will use the following packages: install them before loading them. # 1. Data arrange, importing data, strings and more.

How do they measure the presence of this institution? Acemoglu et al. study institutions with more secure property irghts, and less distortionary policies. They are referred to “good institutions”, and are measured with the Average Protection Against Expropiation Risk that is measured on a scale from 0 to 10. What is their main finding, i.e., how does this institution influence income levels?
